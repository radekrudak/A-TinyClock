# A-TinyClock
Schematic and arduino (Attiny13A) sketch for clock i made with ATtiny13a.

PS. Most files are called Microwave_clock or something like that because it was working name i gave this project bevore A tiny clock cam up to my mind.
    I might or might not change those file names later.
PS. PS.
    Name "MIcrowave clock" came from 7 segment led display i disoldered from microwave oven board and used in this project.
